# Stem Station
Project for a low-cost weather satellite receive station for STEM/STEAM education.

## Origins
This is just the beginning source files. Right now I grab raw data from the NOAA 15, 18, and 19 satellites when I can but the data with the basic antenna I am using is marginal at best. Mostly noise. There is a wave (`*.wav`) file from an APT reception project of [Mark Roland's](http://markroland.com/portfolio/weather-satellite-imaging). I use this file or practice in decoding from a signal that is already FM demodulated and sampled at 11.025 KHz.

## Contents
Right now, the contents are pretty bare but over time look for more source files, example/test files, schematics, mechanical design files, and more.

## Goal
My goal is to generate a full project that can be used for STEM education. With aspects of orbital dynamics, earth science, imaging, digital-signal processing, software engineering, radio signals, and other topics, this could be a great project for classes to look at and build. The goal is to get a system that will be in the $100 range. We'll see if that goal works out in the end.

## Acknowledgements
As with any project, I will be standing on the shoulders of giants
